# Project Name: Maisha Mahrin Personal Portfolio




Link to the hosted Website: [Maisha Mahrin Portfolio](https://maishahoq.github.io/maisha_mahrin/) 



Running the website: Please run the website on Chrome

***Device-Friendly UI:***   

The website is device and screen size friendly which means you can operate it on mobile, tablet, ipad and desktop screens. The outline and design of the website will adapt to the screen size and change as required.

***Project Description:***      

The project is a personal website that demonstrates me as a person, showcases my abilities through the hosted skills and works as a technical portfolio or resume for my technical projects and experiences, which include customer, consulting, creative, backend, and front-end projects, and work experiences.  


***Process:***  

The goal of the website is to serve as a digital portfolio, therefore it needed to be extremely intuitive, user-friendly, and screen-size friendly, so any recruiter or user can skim through my experiences and find the ones they are looking for in a very short period. While settling for a design choice, I skipped through multiple designs and interactions and landed with the current one, where the choice of color expresses me as a person; and the design and the interactions are very intuitive and take you to what skills or experiences you are looking for in a very short time without the user having to skip or skim through other experiences that they might not be interested in. 

So the device is made screen responsive i.e. the outline, menu bar and organization of the contents in the body changes based on the size of the screen.

For the contact form, I tried experimenting with Google App analytics so that I have access to the data sent my the user, instead of the data being saved on the user's own device which happens with traditional front-end only forms





***Reflection/Evaluation:*** 

Overall, figuring out the UX and UI part of the website took the longest, including choosing the color palette, because I needed the website to feel and be viewed at - in a certain way and I wanted to translate that feeling to the user. Also figuring out mobile responsive designing was difficult since it took a lot of effort and web-based learning on my end to incorporate different designs for different screen types on the same website.
